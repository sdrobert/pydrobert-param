Utilities for the python package [param](http://param.pyviz.org/).

While _param_ is a great tool for keeping track of parameters, currently
serialization is restricted to pickling and unpickling objects.
_pydrobert-param_ takes the stance that parameter (de)serialization has an
intuitive and obvious representation in most cases. The developer can modify
how _pydrobert-param_ (de)serializes `param.Parameterized` instances according
to her needs.

A teaser:

``` python
import param
import pydrobert.param.serialization as serial

class Foo(param.Parameterized):
    my_int = param.Integer(10)

first, second = Foo(), Foo()
first.my_int = 30
serial.serialize_to_json('foo.json', first)
serial.deserialize_from_json('foo.json', second)
assert first.my_int == second.my_int
```

While the primary purpose of _pydrobert-param_ is for parameter
(de)serialization, there is also code in `pydrobert.param.optuna` for
hyperparameter optimization via [Optuna](https://optuna.org/). Check the
documentation for more complicated examples of serialization, as well as for
hyperparameter optimization.

**This is student-driven code, so don't expect a stable API. I'll try to use
semantic versioning, but the best way to keep functionality stable is by
pinning the version in the requirements or by forking.**
